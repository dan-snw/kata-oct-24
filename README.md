# Code kata - Oct 2024

Patrick's code kata, which he outlined as follows:

> @engineering I'd been planning to run a kata and it seems timely to announce it after @loris' wonderful presentation on how to write nice PRs. It's a fun little energetic one I've run a couple of times in the past focusing on writing small commits and breaking down your work."
